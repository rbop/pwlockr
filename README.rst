Keybox
======

Introduction
------------

Keybox is a secure store for keys, passwords and other secrets.

There is Python API (``import keybox``), a runnable package (``python3 -m keybox``)
and wrapper script (``keybox``, created by setuptools).

Keybox is completely offline. All secrets stay safe in local file.
Nothing is sent anywhere, unless you explicitly set up network synchronization
using some other tool.

Features:

- Data encrypted using strong encryption (GPG file)
- Simple tab-delimited file format
- Shell-like text user interface

Security:

- Master password is saved in memory for as long as the program runs.
- Neither the password nor decrypted data are ever written to disk.

Portability:

- The script should run on any system with Python3 and GPG installed.
- Requires no installation. You can bring your keybox with you anywhere.
- Can be contained in single Python file (see `Static Distribution`_ below)

Dependencies:

- POSIX OS
- GPG
- Python 3.4 or later


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Python package together with ``keybox`` script, from PyPI::

    pip3 install keybox

Or from source::

    python3 setup.py install

The package can be run directly, without installation::

    python3 -m keybox

Dependencies::

    /usr/share/dict/words (for pwgen, provided by ``wamerican`` on Debian)


Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the program, type master password. New keybox file will be created.

You are now in the shell. The basic workflow is as follows:

- **add** some passwords
- **list** the records
- **select** a record
- **print** the password
- **quit**

See **help** for list of all commands.


Password Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bundled password generator can be called from command line (``keybox pwgen``)
or internally from shell. Try ``<tab>`` when asked for password (add command).

Pwgen is based on system word list usually found in ``/usr/share/dict/words``.
By default, it makes password from two concatenated words, one uppercase letter,
one digit and one punctuation character.

This gives around 50 bits of entropy on my system. [#wiki]_

Static Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call ``make zipapp`` to create [#zipapp]_ file containing all sources.
Zipapp file is written to ``dist`` directory and is directly executable
by Python.

The make target uses ``zipapp`` module which is available since Python 3.5.
When created, the zipapp archive is executable by older interpreters (Python 3.4).

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

Run tests::

    make test

Show test code coverage::

    make htmlcov
